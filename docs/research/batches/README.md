## What state the rows are in (checked 2026-11-06)

- Each file has a "Verification v2" sheet. It records Claude's own re-check of 2026-11-03, not a person's check.
- In every file, the person-checker columns are empty on every row: `checker1_result`, `checker1_name`, `checker2_approved`, `checker2_name` and the rest.
- Some facts were read by a model, from an image or from a search excerpt (WebFetch, image, search_excerpt). There are 109 such rows in all.

So, under R-68, the import loads these rows with Claude's status (`found`, `unconfirmed`, `conflict` and so on) as their trust level.

- No row becomes `verified` until checker 1 and checker 2 are filled in.
- Rows that a model read must be re-fetched, and their quote matched word for word, before they can become `confirmed`.
- Older column layouts (the batch 2 and 3 Programmes sheets) are mapped into the canonical layout by the import (R-67), not by hand.

The files are kept unchanged as the source record. The P2 import (R-68) reads them from here.
